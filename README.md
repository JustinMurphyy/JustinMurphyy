## About Me
- I am a fast learner. I Rap and write music which fills most my freetime other than here! I love to read and obtain new information all the time. I work on many projects from Community Establishment to Game Development. Started on Discord creating servers, to learning how to write my own bots. My Best Quote "If you dont know, figure it out"
